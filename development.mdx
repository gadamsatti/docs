  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### 2. Mobile SDKs

// Add to your build.gradle
implementation 'com.epicmarket:sdk:1.0.0'

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Web Components

Embed EpicMarket features directly in your website:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.epicmarket.com/web-components.js"></script>
