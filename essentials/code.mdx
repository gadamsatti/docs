## Basic Code Examples

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```
To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
```

### Code Block

Use fenced code blocks by enclosing code in three backticks and specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.

```javascript
// Initialize EpicMarket SDK
const epicMarket = new EpicMarket({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  environment: "production",
});

// Create a booking
await epicMarket.bookings.create({
  businessId: "bus_123",
  serviceId: "srv_456",
  datetime: "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z",
});
```

### Request Examples

Show API request examples with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.epicmarket.com/v1/bookings" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "businessId": "bus_123",
    "serviceId": "srv_456",
    "datetime": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Response Examples

Show API response examples:

```json
{
  "id": "bkg_789",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "businessId": "bus_123",
  "serviceId": "srv_456",
  "datetime": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z",
  "created": "2024-01-20T15:00:00Z"
}
```

## Code Groups

Use code groups to show multiple implementation options:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
const epicMarket = new EpicMarket({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});
```

```python Python
epic_market = EpicMarket(
    api_key='YOUR_API_KEY'
)
```

```ruby Ruby
epic_market = EpicMarket.new(
  api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
)
```

</CodeGroup>
